everything is javascript is a
primitive 
or
an 
object

constructor
instances

every js object has a prototype property which makes inheritence possible in js
the prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit
the constructor's prototype property is not the prototype of the constructor itself, it is the prototype of all instances that are created through it
when a certain method or property is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves on to the object's prototype. This continues until the method is found: prototype chain
